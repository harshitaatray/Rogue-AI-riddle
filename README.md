Taking turns with NIM to be the first one to reach zero level

You’re on a special mission to save the world from a hostile artificial intelligence called NIM. It’s taken over computers all over the globe and you only have one opportunity to shut it down. NIM will also be working against you, so calculate carefully. Here are the puzzle rules as you float in a boat on 25 stories of water:

You and NIM take turns lowering the water level exactly to 1, 3, or 4 stories. You go first. The water starts at level 25. Whoever lowers the water to level 0 wins. No one can skip a turn or lower the water below 0.
